This is a module to aid in processing of liquid chromatography data.
It includes an easy interface to perform many operations required to process and analyse
chromatography data, such as:\n
0- Smoothing\n
1- Baseline correction\n
2- Search for peak and determine the width at a given relative height\n
3- Detect fused peaks and determine the start and end of each of them\n
4- Peak purity\n
